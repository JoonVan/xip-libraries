The following changes have been made based on DCMTK 3.5.4:
 
1. dcmdata.dsp: Removed _REENTRANT pre-processor flag
 
The default dsp-file defines this flag to ensure thread-
safety of the library. However, this comes with a 
performance penalty of more than 20%. Because in RAD the 
DICOM dictionary is not modified, JPEG codecs are 
registered on plugin loading time and all other accesses
to global structures are read-only, thread-safety is not
required.
 

2. dcelem.h: Added public member method to DcmElement class
 
A public accessor getInputStreamFactory() was added for the 
private member fLoadValue. This is needed to support direct 
file-mapping of the pixel data.
 

3. dcistrmf.h: Added stream position tracking member
 
A member variable to track the current stream position was 
added to boost the performance of reading DICOM files. This 
member will be used instead of ftell() function call.
 

4. dcistrmf.cpp: Use of pos_ instead of ftell()
 
At a number of places the pos_ member variable is updated 
whenever the stream position changes. Also pos_ is returned 
when rather that using ftell().
