FTGL

FTGL is a free, open source library to enable developers to use arbitrary fonts
in their OpenGL (www.opengl.org) applications. Unlike other OpenGL font libraries
FTGL uses standard font file formats so doesn't need a preprocessing step to
convert the high quality font data into a lesser quality, proprietary format.
FTGL uses the Freetype (www.freetype.org) font library to open and 'decode' the
fonts. It then takes that output and stores it in a format most efficient for
OpenGL rendering. FTGL is designed to be used in commercial quality software.
It has been written with performance, robustness and simplicity in mind.
