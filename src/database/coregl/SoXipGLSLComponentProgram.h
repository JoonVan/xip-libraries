/**
 *  Component       : XIP
 *  Name            : SoXipGLSLComponentProgram
 *  Author          : Lindholm S, SCR, Princeton
 *  Language        : C++
 *  Creation Date   : 2-Oct-2007
 *  Description     :   Reimplementation of SoXipLoadShader.
 *                      Purpose is to provide ability to load
 *                      multiple shaders from a single node and
 *                      to use 'conditioned recompilation'.
 *                      "compile only what must be compiled"
 *                      TODO! See non-member function xip_mshaders_tokensize(...)
