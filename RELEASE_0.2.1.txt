============================================
Release 0.2.1
============================================

XipBuilder bug fixes and changes:
---------------------------------

	Feature: 	Changed saving methods to use QT for getting the system time and creating 
						directories to ensure cross platform compatibility. Also changed it to store backup and temp files 
						in a "bak" subdirectory.
	Feature: 	Show scene object's name (when set) in connect button tool tip
	
	Fix: 	Prevented the user from saving scenes that have packages with empty outside connections (since this cannot 
				be handled correctly with the current file format. Empty inside connections are OK though).
	Fix: 	Corrupted package connections when one end of the connection is not connected
	Fix: 	Wrong assignment of package connections when saving empty inside connections
	Fix: 	A segmentation fault happens if the user presses and holds BOTH mouse buttons and tries to load a scene graph 
				using recent graphs option.
	Fix: 	Moving the window when pressing left mouse button on close/minimize/restore or tool bar buttons and moving
				it before releasing the mouse button
	Fix: 	Removed unnecessary linking of Qt Ax libs
	Fix: 	Pressing tab key in field panels jumps two fields instead of one
	Fix: 	Crash on mouse click on "Properties" bottom bar's "Field" label when no scene graph is loaded
	Fix: 	Correctly load corrupted scene graphs:
				Made sure inventor does not jump to eof on error and set the file ptr to the end of the object which 
				caused the read error by counting braces. This has to be done since SoBase::flushInput(SoInput *in) 
				(which is called by inventor in case of a read error) counts the braces in a wrong way if the error 
				occurs at the "node/engine" field of XIP Builder nodes
	Fix: 	Memory leak caused by incorrect deletion of render views: When a render view 
				was closed manually, the render view widget object was not deleted, just it's reference in 
				the corresponding vector.
	
	Minor change: Removed the node list item's icons


New experimental Features:	
---------------------------------

These features are in beta status and not yet fully tested. They should not be used for productive development!

Qt Ui Viewer Node:
	New node SoXipIvQtUiViewer loads a scene graph into a customized GUI. The GUI is specified by a .ui file that can 
	easily be created with the Qt Designer. The functionality can be defined in one or more Qt Script files (.js/.qs) 
	that are also responsible for the interaction with the scene graph.
	
	In order to be able to load the scene graph it is necessary to add a widget to the .ui file and promote it to 
	"QXipIvRenderWidget" with the object name "widget".
	
	An example for the use of the Qt Ui Viewer can be found in examples/qtuiviewer.

HTML Viewer Node:
	New node XipHtmlViewer, which allows embedding a scene graph renderer into an HTML page. Back-and-forth communication 
	between the scene graph and the HTML page is available through Javascript. The HTML rendering engine is QtWebKit, a wrapper 
	around the open source engine WebKit.
	
	An example for the use of the HTML Viewer can be found in examples/htmlview.
	The interface to the scene graph is provided by the SoXipHtmlViewer node. It works like a group node, any nodes below will 
	be rendered in the HTML render area. On its show trigger, it will open a QtWebkit window that will display the configured 
	html file.
	
	The interface on the HTML-side consists of two parts that concern rendering the scene graph on the one hand and interacting 
	with it from Javascript on the other hand. 

Standalone Viewer:
	The standalone application views the scene graph in a GUI defined by either an HTML or a Qt Ui 
	file, that is given as an argument by running standaloneviewer.exe. If it is run without 
	an argument it will try to find and open "html/main.html" by default.
	
	Besides the dlls that are specified in the extensions.xml additional dlls can be loaded, either 
	by providing their single names or an xml file (like extensions.xml) inside the HTML file.
	
	Also in the HTML or UI file, the scene graph which is to be loaded, has to be specified. The 
	standalone application can only handle .iv files. The UI files also have to specify the Qt Script 
	file(s) that ought to be loaded. Therefore at the bottom of the HTML or UI file the following 
	needs to be added:
	
	<!--LoadIVFile scenegraph.iv-->
	<!--LoadScriptFiles script1,js,script2.js--> (only in UI files)
	<!--LoadDLL xipivcorepro,xipivutils,xipivvtk--> (optional)
	<!--LoadDLLConfigFile extensions.xml--> (optional)
	
	The scene graph itself does not need to contain a SoXipHtmlViewer or SoXipIvQtUiViewer node as 	
	it wraps the functionality of the core of either one around the whole scene graph.
	
	For your projects please create a directory "html" for the html content or "ui" for the ui and
	script content on the same level that contains the IV file.
