Welcome to the XIP Libraries&trade; Project!
============================================

The [eXtensible Imaging Platform&trade; (XIP&trade;)](http://www.OpenXIP.org) is an
Open Source project that provides a framework for developing image processing and
visualization applications.  While XIP's emphasis is medical applications, it can be 
used for other types of applications.

The XIP Libraries&trade; component of XIP&trade; provide a set of image processing
and visualization primatives layered on top of the
[Open Inventor&trade;](http://oss.sgi.com/projects/inventor/) object-oriented 3D toolkit.
The XIP Libraries are written primarily in c++.

The ultimate goals of the project include:

* Provide a core set of Open Inventor&trade; nodes and engines that facilitate the 
  creation of image processing and visualization applications.
* Wrap the [ITK](http://itk.org/) and [VTK](http://vtk.org/) libraries, so that they
  can easily be incorporated into XIP-based applications.
* Allow for easy user extension by adding new Open Inventor&trade; nodes and engines.
* Add 'glue' objects that allow easy interconnection of the various libraries.
* Allow simple binding to languages other than c++.
* Support editable XML descriptions of a scene graphs, including processing pipelines.
